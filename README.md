Day 19 of my Python journey
Today i learn about getters and setters in python
-getters and setters are methods that you create to control how attributes of your class accessed and modified.
-they are key part of the principle of encapsulation 
*Why use them ?
1) validation:- You can add checks within the setter to make sure the attribute is set to valid a value.
2)Read only attributes:- you can use getter without setter making the attribute read only from outside the box.
There are many more advantages for using getter and setters
